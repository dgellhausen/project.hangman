# Hangman
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.

## Objective
Create the game Hangman. This project will test your knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. This will also require a basic understanding of functions, arrays and loops.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Optional:
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

\* Note: Bootstrap is included if you would like to use it. However, it is possible to complete this assignment using pure CSS.

## To-Do

- Allow a user's letter input to associate with the letters from the random word.
- If a user's input is incorrect then represent this by illustrating a body part.
